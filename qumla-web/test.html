		<span class="c1">Qumla, Inc (&quot;</span><span class="c1 c9">Qumla</span><span

			class="c1">&quot; or &quot;</span><span class="c1 c9">us</span><span

			so much focus on protecting your privacy and personal information.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span class="c1">This Privacy Policy covers the Qumla website
			(&quot;</span><span class="c1 c9">Site</span><span class="c1">&quot;)
			and any Qumla application or service (&quot;</span><span class="c1 c9">Services</span><span
			class="c1">&quot;). It explains how our Site or Services
			collect, use, protect, and disclose personal information, Usage data,
			and Message data (we define these last two terms below). Please note
			that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of, or content
			on, third party services or other properties to which our Site or the
			Services link, or into which our Services are embedded or
			incorporated (e.g., Qumla embeds).</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4 c6">
		<span class="c10 c9">What Information We Collect</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c0">
		<span class="c7">Personal Information and Anonymity</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span class="c1">We collect very little information that could
			be used to identify you personally. A non-unique username is randomly
			assigned to you that you may change at any time. If you change your
			username, please be sure to create a username that doesn&rsquo;t
			disclose any personally identifying information. If you decide to
			invite your friends to use the Services via our &ldquo;invite
			friends&rdquo; feature, you will also need to reveal your cell phone
			number to your friend when you send the invitation. No mobile number
			or email address is ever stored on our servers.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span class="c1">Our goal is to provide you with a tool that
			allows you to express yourself while remaining anonymous to the
			community. However, please keep in mind that your questions will be
			publicly viewable, so if you want to preserve your anonymity you
			should not include any personal information in your questions. In
			addition, when you allow us to collect latitude and longitude
			location information from your device by enabling locations services,
			your general location (e.g., town) and proximity to other users when
			you post, will also be publicly viewable. Therefore, even if you do
			not include personal information in your questions, your use of the
			Services may still allow others, over time, to make a determination
			as to your identity based on the content of your questions as well as
			your general location. For instance, if you work in a small
			organization and post questions about your working experience, it is
			possible that at some point a co-worker will be able to identify you.
			This is part of the nature of the Services, and we encourage you to
			be careful and avoid including details that may be used by others to
			identify you.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c0">
		<span class="c7">Usage Data</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span class="c1">We automatically collect usage information.
			This doesn&rsquo;t tell us who a user is, though. It just lets us
			collect information about how people access and use our Services.
			This collected information is called Usage Data. We gather it so we
			can get a better portrait of how our users are interacting with the
			Site and Services so that we can continue to improve the user
			experience over time.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span class="c1">Here are a few examples of Usage Data:</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span class="c1">When you download and use our Services, we
			automatically collect information about the type of device
			you&rsquo;re using, the operating system version on your device and
			your IP Address. Or if you&rsquo;re using the Site, we automatically
			collect information about your operating system, web browser,
			Internet Service Provider (ISP), and your network-enabled
			machine&rsquo;s Internet Protocol (IP) address, as well as the pages
			you view, and the time and length of your visit. This data helps us
			analyze trends and user behaviors, manage the site, and enhance or
			update our Services. In other words, it helps us give you a better
			experience by understanding and reacting to the ways that users
			interact with the Services and Site.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span class="c1">While you&rsquo;re downloading or using our
			mobile applications or Services, we may ask for, access, or track
			location-based information such as device-provided latitude or
			longitude, if you have location services enabled for the application.
			One reason for doing this is to help you explore postings in your
			area or for us to determine how many postings come from a particular
			area. If you are using an Android device, our Services may continue
			to run in the background. In this instance, your device may also
			periodically send us location information. However, giving us
			permission to access or track any location-based data is absolutely
			voluntary. In fact, you may freely opt into or opt out of
			location-based portions of our Services at any time using the app- or
			device-level settings on iOS or the device-level settings on Android.
			However, please bear in mind that, even if you have disabled location
			services, we may still determine your city, state, and country
			location based on your IP address (but not your exact location).</span>

	<p class="c0">
		<span class="c7">Cookies</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span class="c1">Like many other websites, our Site uses
			cookies. These are small, removable data files that your web browser
			stores to help identify your computer and browser when you visit a
			website. They can also have the added benefit of speeding up your
			access to sites. We don&rsquo;t use cookies to collect personal
			information. Instead, we use them to improve the quality of our Site
			and Services. Our Site is not designed to respond to &ldquo;do not
			track&rdquo; signals received from browsers.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span class="c1">Most web browsers are initially set up to

	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span class="c1">Some of the Service Providers (we define this
			below) that we work with may use their own cookies in connection with
			the services they perform on our behalf. We don&rsquo;t have access
			or control over these cookies. The use of cookies by these third

		<span class="c10 c9">How We May Use Your Information</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span class="c1">We use the information that we collect from
			you for internal purposes. This includes offering you access to the
			Site and Services, letting you know when we have new products or
			Services, and communicating with you in other ways.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span class="c1">We will not share your information except in

		<span class="c9 c10">How We May Disclose Your Information</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span class="c1">Qumla is committed to the privacy and security
			of your information, including preserving your anonymity; however,
			there are a few cases when we will be unable to do so. Here are a few
			situations where we may disclose the information that we collect from
			you.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c0">
		<span class="c7">First, we respect the Law</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span class="c1">This means that we may disclose information
			such as your created questions, IP address, and your location, if
			known, if we have a good faith belief it is necessary to comply with
			applicable laws, regulations, legal processes (such as a subpoena or
			court order) or enforceable governmental requests. If you want to
			learn more about how we do that, please review our&nbsp;</span><span

				Enforcement Response Guide</a></span><span class="c1">.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c0">
		<span class="c7">Second, we expect you to respect the Law as
			well</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span class="c1">Whisper is not a place to harbor criminals.
			You must not use the Site or Services to plan, incite, promote, or
			showcase any criminal act is strictly prohibited. This includes
			statements revealing plans or actions around human trafficking,
			sexual exploitation, or predation. These types of behaviors are
			against our mission, constitute a breach of our Terms of Service, and
			more importantly, are illegal. If you engage in any illegal activity
			we may be required, or choose to, share the information we may have
			about you with the appropriate authorities.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c0">
		<span class="c7">Third, we don&#39;t want anybody to be harmed</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span class="c1">Whisper is meant to be a safe place. There may
			be situations where we may need to disclose the information we may
			have about you for the greater good, such as if we see suicidal
			statements or statements that involve the intent to harm oneself or
			others, or learn information about missing children, or threats to
			the community.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c0">
		<span class="c7">We may also share your information for
			technical reasons</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span class="c1">From time to time, we may establish business
			relationships with other businesses but will only do so if we believe
			they are trustworthy. We carefully vet these relationships to confirm
			that these service providers have privacy practices that are
			consistent with ours. These service providers may include companies
			that provide us with services such as hosting and maintenance,
			customer relationship management, push notifications, and data
			storage and management.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span class="c1">We give service providers only the information
			that&rsquo;s necessary for them to perform services on our behalf.
			What&rsquo;s more, each service provider must agree to use security
			procedures and practices that are reasonable and appropriate for the
			information involved. This is another way that we work to protect
			your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Also,
			we prohibit our service providers from using your information in any
			manner that is not specified by us.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span class="c1">In addition, we may use and disclose certain
			Usage Data to third parties. This Usage Data doesn&rsquo;t identify
			individual users. We use mobile analytics software to help us better
			understand how our Services work on your device. This software may
			only record information usage information, such as how often you use
			the application, the events that occur within the application,
			aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was
			downloaded. But we do not link the information we store within the
			analytics software to any personally identifiable information you
			submit within the mobile app. This essentially only covers what you
			do, but not who does it. We may also partner with universities or
			other research institutions or scientists to use the limited
			information we have in anonymous, controlled research studies.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c0">
		<span class="c7">Affiliates and Corporate Transactions</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span class="c1">We may share the information that we collect
			from you with businesses that control, are controlled by, or are
			under common control with Qumla. This also means that if Qumla is
			merged, acquired, or sold, or in the event of a transfer of some or
			all of our assets, we may disclose or transfer such information in
			connection with that particular transaction.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c0">
		<span class="c7">Information Security</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span class="c1">Qumla is committed to protecting the security
			of your personal information and Message Data. This is why we employ
			security measures designed to protect your personal information from
			unauthorized access (for instance we encrypt private messages).
			Regardless of our efforts, however, no data transmission over the
			Internet or other network, including any of Qumla&rsquo;s services,
			can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We will do our part, but we
			can&rsquo;t and don&rsquo;t guarantee the security of any information
			you transmit on or through the Site or Services. Thus, any
			information you transmit is sent at your own risk.</span>

	<p class="c0">
		<span class="c7">Protecting Children&#39;s Privacy</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span class="c1">We do not knowingly collect any personal
			information from children under the age of 17. You must be over the
			age of 17 to use our Site and Services. If we determine you are under
			17 we may in our discretion decide to ban you from the Services.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c0">
		<span class="c7">Your Information may be maintained outside of
			your jurisdiction</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span class="c1">Please be advised that we process and store
			all information in Hungary or other countries where our service
			providers may be based. This may be important to you, as the laws of
			Hungary or such other countries may not be as protective of your
			personal information as the laws of your jurisdiction.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c0">
		<span class="c7">Deleting your account</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span class="c1">Upon your request, we delete your account. You

	<p class="c4">
		<span class="c1">You are free to opt out of push notifications

			that you have those settings turned off both in the Qumla settings
			and in the settings on your mobile device.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c0">
		<span class="c7">Changes to the Privacy Policy</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c4">
		<span class="c1">We may periodically change this Privacy
			Policy. If we decide to make material changes to this Privacy Policy,
